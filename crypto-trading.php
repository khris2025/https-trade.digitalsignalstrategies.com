                <h5>What is a cryptocurrency?</h5>
                <p>
                    A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is a virtual currency traded peer-to-peer on a blockchain, independent
                    of centralized authorities like banks and governments. Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual, so they
                    are not backed by physical commodities and have no intrinsic value.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</h5>
                <p>
                    Primarily, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to complete a transaction via an intricate
                    P2P network. Once a transfer request is entered into the network, it is validated by the network and
                    added to a pool of other transactions to create a block of data for the ledger, which is then entered
                    into the existing blockchain. Once the block is successfully added to the chain, the transaction is
                    approved and completed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Are There Investment Opportunities with Cryptocurrencies?</h5>
                <p>
                    Absolutely. Cryptocurrencies have become established investment commodities among major financial
                    institutions and have even been adopted by countries such as Australia and Japan. As with any
                    investment though, there are risks linked to market movements, high volatility and economics.
