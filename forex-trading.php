        <h5 class="mb-2">What is Margin?</h5>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                Margin is the amount of a trader’s funds required to open a new position. It is estimated based on the size of your trade, which is measured in lots. A standard lot is 100,000 units. We also provide mini lots (10,000 units), micro lots (1,000 units), and nano lots (100 units). The greater the lot, the bigger the margin amount.
                Margin allows you to trade with leverage, enabling you to place trades larger than your actual capital. Leverage also affects the required margin.

        <h5 class="mb-2">What is Leverage?</h5>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p>
                Leverage is the ability to trade positions larger than the capital you possess. It allows traders to use borrowed funds from a broker to increase their trade size. For example, 1:100 leverage means that a trader with $1,000 can control a position of $100,000. While leverage can increase potential profits, it also magnifies potential losses, putting capital at risk.
